\subsection*{Selected Publications}
`Search for CP violation in Neutrino and Antineutrino Oscillations by the T2K experiment with 2.2$\times 10^{21}$ protons on target' \cite{oa2017prl}
\vspace{-.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
%% \item Lead analyser for Bayesian analysis. Responsibilities included incorporating advances in neutrino interaction models into the analysis, validating the fit framework and performing final fits to data
%% \item This analysis resulted in the world's first exclusion at 95\% confidence level of the CP conserving values of $\delta_{CP}$
\item This publication has been accepted by Physical Review Letters as an editor's suggestion and is currently available at arXiv:1807.07891
\end{itemize}

`Measurement of neutrino and antineutrino oscillations by the T2K experiment including a new additional sample of $\nu_e$ interactions at the far detector'\cite{Abe:2017vif}
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item One of the lead analysers responsible for adding new kinematic variables to the Bayesian analysis
%% \end{itemize}

`Updated T2K measurements of muon neutrino and antineutrino disappearance using 1.5$\times$10$^{21}$ protons on target' \cite{Abe:2017bay}

`Vector Boson Fusion Searches for Dark Matter at the LHC' \cite{Brooke:2016vlw}
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Lead experimental analyser responsible for estimating sensitivity of the CMS experiment to phenomenological dark matter models
%% \end{itemize}

`Searches for invisible decays of the Higgs boson in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7, 8, and 13 TeV' \cite{Khachatryan:2016whc}
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Lead analyser of 7 and 8 TeV data in the most sensitive VBF channel responsible for background estimation, systematic uncertainty studies and setting of limits of the Higgs boson invisible branching fraction
%% \item Led the statistical combination of the separate searches and studies of correlations between channels in the 7 and 8 TeV data
%% \item This paper has so far received 119 citations (inSPIRE HEP, October 2018)
%% \end{itemize}

`Search for invisible decays of Higgs bosons in the vector boson fusion and associated ZH production modes' \cite{Chatrchyan:2014tja} %!!
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item One of the lead analysers responsible for background estimation, systematic uncertainty studies and the setting of limits on the Higgs boson invisible branching fraction in the most powerful VBF channel
%% \item Led the statistical combination of the separate searches and studies of correlations between channels
%% \item This paper has so far received 232 citations (inSPIRE HEP, October 2018)
%% \end{itemize}
